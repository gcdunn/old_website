#### Figures
Figure 1. is an illustration of the synchronized halo pair model with background galaxies that provided low-level LW radiation that prevents star formation in the DCBH halo.

Figure 2. illustrates the redshift evolution of the LW field.  The field is turned on at redshift 35, corresponding to the onset of starformation in the background galaxies.

Figure 3. illustrates the metallicity evolution of the DCBH halo in the presence of a starforming neighbor and background galaxies.  The direct collapse window is highlighted against the onset of metal pollution.

#### Summary
This paper builds on the Regan Nature (2017) paper and describes an analytic model for the metal enrichment of the DCBH halo over time due to the outflow of mass and metals from the nearby source.  They find that the metallicity of the DCBH halo does not exceed their critical threshold until the end of the synchronization window.  (Though it does reach within a factor of 2-3 so what is the confidence in the threshold?)
  
What is the reference for the 10^-5 metallicity threshold?
