This paper investigates the "synchronized pair" Lyman-Werner initiated DCBH model.  They claim that star formation must be prevented in the DCBH halo and a nearby starbust proto-galaxy must provide the critical Lyman-Werner radiation at the time of the gravitational collapse of the DCBH halo.  They argue that star formation can be delayed in the DCBH halo by a moderate cosmic LW background field (~100 J21, initiated at z=35), and synchronized exposure to high LW radiaiton from a starbust galaxy will push to DCBH halo into the isothermal atomic cooling regime.

*How strong a spatial and temporal correlation is required to form DCBH through synchronized-pairs?*  
The background LW radiation is designed to mimick an effective background temperature of 30,000K, which is representative of the expected radiaiton from a background of Pop III and Pop II stars.  The effect of the background radiation is to delay, but not prevent, star formation through H2 cooling.  *This background radiation is more effective at delaying star formation in lower mass halos.*  The authors find a critical distance between the primary and secondary halos of ~300 pc, although they expect this distance will vary with the luminosity model and stellar mass of the primary halo.  They find synchronization timescales ranging from thousands to millions of years. A more general statement of the spatial synchronization os the that the virial radii of the primary and secondary halos should overlap (the virial radius of the secondary in these simulations is 300 pc).
  
Figure 1. A schematic representation of synchronized atomic cooling halos.  The syncronization time is defined as the window between when the starburst accoring in the neighboring galaxy and when the DCBH halo would have formed Pop III stars without the extra Lyman-Werner exposure.

Figure 2. Ray profiles for six sample halos.  They conclude that the starburst halo must be less than ~300 pc from the atomic cooling halo in order to incite direct collapse.  

Figure 3. "The sychronized halo zone".  In physical separation - synchronization time space, they break down the different regimes to identify the zones that are excluded due to ram pressure stripping, insufficient LW flux, metal pollution and "unavoidable" Pop III star formation.  In the case of insufficient flux, an H2 core forms in the center of the halo, enabling non-isothermal collapse.

Figure 4. Mass inflow rates.  Direct collapse is thought to require 0.1 solar masses per year of inflow over the course of a million years.  The largest mass inflow rates correspond with the largest LW flux/smallest physical separation.

The DCBH recipe requires:
1. Strong LW radiation
2. Prevent metal enrichment OR slow/inefficient metal mixing
3. Prevent photo-evaporation
