Lots of great cartoons for talks in this paper!  
  
#### Figures
Figure 1. is a cartoon of the "quasar timing problem", illustrating possible combinations of massive black hole seed masses and modes fo growth.  

Figure 2.  is a cartoon of the temperature-density relation required to fuel the collapse of pristine gas in an atomic cooling halo.  The two paths shown are the evolutionary tracks with Lyman-Werner cooling suppression versus H2/metal line cooling.  

Figure 3. is a cartoon model for the the galactic outflow of CR7.  

Figure 4. demonstrates the observed velocity shift for CR7 and that expected from reprocessing of Lyman alpha photons by the intergalactic medium.

#### SMBH growth modes possible in a cosmological context include:  
* episodic galaxy mergers  
* cold flow gas from cosmic filaments  

#### Possible modes of quasar seed formation in a cosmological context:  
* runaway collapse of gas occurs in systems with low angular momentum, which translates into a reduced barrier to centrifugal motion (Eisenstein & Loeb, 1995)  

#### Three most popular models for quasar seed formation:  
1. direct collapse  
2. super-Eddington accretion onto Pop III remnants
   * Is this sustainable over long periods of time?  Winds from massive stars and supernoave evacuate gas from the system.
3. runaway collisions in nuclear star clusters  

#### Properties of AGN in reference to radiation form the first BHs:
* broadband emission ranging across optical to X-ray, peaks in the UV 
* feedback from Lyman alpha photon trapping

#### Mentions of CR7 in reference to observational evidence:  
* strong Lyman alpha emission
* strong Helium II 1640 Angstrom emission
* no metal lines observed in the range from UV to IR light
* 160 km/s velocity offset between Lyman alpha and HeII lines is reproduced by DCBH model
