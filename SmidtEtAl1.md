1. Introduction  
Evidence against Pop III seeds:  Ionizing UV flux from these stars can evacuate all of the baryons fron their parent halos, so the Pop III BH remnants form in low gas density regions, which inhibits rapid growth.  X-ray radiation from these BHs can "evaporate cosmological flows" from the halo until it reaches a mass such that the halo escape velocity is larger that the sound spped of the ionized gas.  Pop III remnant BHs are also prone to natal kicks that may eject them from their host halos, so they would lose access to accretable mass.  

The novelty here is that they are bridging the gap between the scales of quasar growth and cosmic flow over redshift ranges from formation to qusar observations (z~7).

2. Numerical method  
The halo is seeds with a black hole once it crosses the atomic cooling threshold.  They do not artificially cap the accretion limit, but cite that the x-ray and supernova feedback keep the accretion rate sub-Eddington.
  
3. SMBH/Host galaxy coevolution 
Here they give a nice narrative of how the BH and halo grow together, citing the effect of mergers on star formation and BH accretion.
